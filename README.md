The Simon Says Game is a memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors. With each round, a new color is added, and the player must click the buttons in the exact same order. The game continues until the player makes a mistake.

How I Made It:
I created this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The color buttons are styled with CSS, and JavaScript handles the core logic â€” generating random sequences, playing sound and animations, and checking user input. I used event listeners to detect clicks and compare them with the generated pattern to determine if the player wins or loses.
